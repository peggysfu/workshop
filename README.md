# Workshop

A shared repository for a tutorial

1. Create a fork of this repository in your own GitHub account.

1. Use GitHub Desktop to clone or download your forked repository to your computer.

1. Make some changes to your repository. Open the file named for your initials and add some content. You can use any text editor for this. I like to use Atom.

1. Use GitHub Desktop to commit your changes.

1. Push your changes to GitHub.

1. Create a Pull Request. You can use GitHub Desktop or the GitHub website to do this.

1. Merge your pull request.

1. Update your fork of the repository.

This is a really fun workshop.
